                  <p><b>Challenges: </b>Since it had been about five years since I last worked on a C# project, I did not remember the syntax and and the project was totally a relearning process. Furthermore, at that time, I didn't have the core programming knowledge necessary for working with frameworks like ASP.NET.</p>
                  <p><b>Solutions: </b>To overcome this, I re-familiarized myself with ASP.NET by building the project step by step, typing out code line by line and referencing official documentation whenever I encountered parts I didn't understand. This approach helped me <b>rebuild my programming fundamentals with the ASP.NET framework</b> and <b>strengthen my understanding of its structure.</b></p>
                  
                  <h5 class="tab__title">Implementing Authentication Beyond Course Requirements</h5>
                  <p><b>Challenges: </b>Wanting to challenge myself further, I decided to implement user authentication - a feature not required by the course. Working with OAuth login was overwhelming, and the biggest issue was me being afraid of breaking the project structure.</p>
                  <p><b>Solutions: </b>To tackle this, I sought guidance from my professor, who helped me understand the necessary configurations with namespace. With this support, I successfully added a basic user account flow. Eventually, I managed to integrate <b>Google OAuth login</b> into the project</p>
                  <p>Even though I couldn't implement other platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook due to more complex approval processes, researching different OAuth workflows for various platforms was a valuable learning experience.</p>

                  <p>This group project, combining skills from both our Programming and Project Management classes, aimed to analyze and improve the existing Kirkland District Hospital website. In the project planning phase, we identified key flaws of the current website and the work flow, including difficulty to use the hospital services, lack of staff-patient interaction, poor UI, and workflow inefficiencies. As a result, we implemented targeted improvements to <b>enhance the website's functionality, usability, and overall efficiency</b>, applying both technical and strategic project management principles.</p>

                  <p><b>Challenges: </b>One of the biggest challenges in this project was coding the shapes themselves. Creating precise shapes with only CSS took a lot of trial and error</p>
                  <p><b>Solutions: </b>To manage this, I tackled the project piece by piece, coding each element patiently. For the shapes I couldn't quite get right with CSS alone, I used actual images as a workaround. In the end, I was able to complete everything on time.</p>
                  <p>Despite the challenges, I found the process really fun. One of my favorite parts of the project is the sky animation — the sky colour changes dynamically based on the position of the sun.</p>

                    <li>Player controls ship in a 2D water-based map.</li>
                    <li>Enemy ships spawn in waves. Player gains points by shooting down the enemy ship.</li>
                    <li>Player can choose the game's difficulty level, which affects how fast and how many enemy ships appear.</li>
                    <li>The map layout is carefully designed with details.</li>
                    <li>Explosion sprites are triggered upon enemy ship destruction.</li>

                  <p><b>Challenges: </b>Initially, making the ship rotate smoothly based on player input was tricky. I wanted the ship to feel responsive but natural, avoiding stiff or awkward movement.</p>
                  <p><b>Solutions: </b>I watched multiple tutorials on YouTube, and reviewed demo code from class. After trial and error, I implemented a solution that resulted in smooth rotation based on directional input. It really gave the movement a more polished touch.</p>
                  
                  <p><b>Challenges: </b>Due to the stage layout I built, I noticed the gameplay was too easy at certain points even at high difficulty. The enemy ships couldn't navigate around the environment well.</p>
                  <p><b>Solutions: </b>I tried several online tutorials and AI navigation methods, including Unity's built-in NavMesh and alternative 2D pathfinding solutions. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it fully working before the deadline. After submission, I reached out to my professor, but we didn't get the chance to go through the code. Even though it's unfinished, it's an area I'm motivated to improve in for future projects.</p>

                  <p><b>Challenges: </b>Designing the map took a lot of time because I tend to pick up the small details to fix without focusing on the important features.</p>
                  <p><b>Solutions: </b>Multiple times, I had to make the decision to cut down on the scale that I initially envisioned in order to meet the deadline. I finished the project in time at the end, however, planning out the scale and the details would definitely help in future projects.</p>
                  
                  <p><b>Challenges: </b>Debugging time took tremendously long</p>
                  <p><b>Solutions: </b>Because of the assets and the amount of objects I put in the scene, it took a lot of time to load and test each change. I could not develop the game as efficiently as I wanted, but I would love to learn more to optimize the workflow in game development in Unity.</p>
